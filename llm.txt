## Used LLM Tools:
Gemini AI

## Motivation:
As this was my first time using Linux, I needed to familiarize myself with various commands and their functionalities. 
Also want to get the good format for the running process.

## How LLM helped:
1. It provided explanations and examples of Linux commands, which helped me understand how to use them effectively.
2. It helped me format the output in a JSON format.


## Mistakes LLM did:
One major mistakes it is doing like, after setting up my docker, and after runnign the command for the first time in linux,
for docker build up, I got so many error. And after some time when I confused about
my docker setup and the errors, I asked LLM to help me to find the error, but 
it gave me more error with its answer, which complicated the things very much.

## LLM not able to provided

I must say The LLM struggled to provide accurate and straightforward solutions and by how many time you 
want the answer for the same time ( in my case for docker setup error ) it gave me same
to same answer four to five times.
