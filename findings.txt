In this exercise I work with two services and setup the Docker files accrodingly.
Service1 and Service 2 both running in different not connected containers, but I find
that they share some tings with host.

1. service 1's and service 2's containers have access to hsot file system. When I show the Available disk space
So both of them  can check the free space on host.
2. After that I use "ps" on both services to know about the running process. Both contianer are not connected,
but as I am geting info from host.
3. The most key findings for me is about the network.
   Service 1(devops-dockerexercise_service1) port 8199
   Service2 (devops-dockerexercise_service2) port 5000
Here we can see that each container have its on IP for its network and different ports as
well. But both containers share the same docker network [4f8d624f5f12   devops-dockerexercise_default]
and this shared networkallows them to commmunicate with each other.

Lastly, docker's container is from my thinking efficient way to run the application. They run
on isolated but share the host's things, which also makes docker an efficient tool to deploy 
application isolated yet interconnected application.
